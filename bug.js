While working on an Expo project, I encountered an issue where the app crashed unexpectedly on certain Android devices. The error messages were inconsistent and unhelpful, making debugging difficult. The crash seemed to be related to async storage, particularly when dealing with large amounts of data. I found that using AsyncStorage.setItem() with large JSON objects could cause the app to crash on some devices, while it worked fine on others.
